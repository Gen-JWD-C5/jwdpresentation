**Purpose of the project:**
The project was to design and implement a Task Planner that can have functionality of :

- **Adding tasks and Displaying them**
    The app should be able to take input task information and render it to the user interface according to the status of the task.
    When adding a task, the task form validates user information using JavaScript.  The Add Task form contains prompts for the user to facilitate correct information input.
    If all information is validated, it gets rendered in the correct status-column.  

- **Updating Tasks**
  As the task is updated, the task card moves to the correct status-column. When a Task-Card is in Done column, it can't be updated.
 
- **Deleting Tasks**
  The card can be deleted at any point by clicking a bin icon on each task card.
  
**Design**
The layout of the Task Planner was designed using Balsamiq. It is inspired by Kanban Task Board.The Task Cards have been designed to look like Sticky Notes.

**Project Model**
The project was implemented using Agile Methodology - whereby each morning the team members met at discussed their tasks and the status of the tasks assigned to them.

**Software** 
This task planner was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript.
