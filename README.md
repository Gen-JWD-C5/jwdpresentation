Purpose of the project:

Task planner app created as a final project for Generation Australia Web Developer Program.
The app should be able to take input task information and render it to the user interface according to the status of the task

The layout of the planner was designed using Balsamiq.
This task planner was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript.

When adding a task, the task form validates user information using JavaScript.  The add task form contains prompts for the user to facilitate correct information input.

If all information is validates, it should rendered in the correct status-column.  As the task is updated, the task card should move to the correct status-column.  The card can be deleted at any point.
